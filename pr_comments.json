Ensure you\nreference MessageRouter.Broadcast and notifySubscribers (and follow the same\npattern used in Route) when making the change.\n\nIn `@apps/runtime/internal/agentmessaging/service.go`:\n- Around line 323-362: The AddMessageToConversation method has a TOCTOU risk\nbecause s.mu is unlocked after checking s.conversations[conversationID] and then\nre-locked later; consolidate into a single critical section: acquire s.mu once\nat the start of Service.AddMessageToConversation, check existence, append msg to\nconv.Messages, update conv.UpdatedAt, set s.replyTo[msg.ID], and append the\nMessageHistoryEntry to s.history while still holding s.mu, then release the lock\n(use defer for safety); keep calls to s.summarizeMessage outside the lock if\nit’s expensive and does not require protected state, otherwise call it inside\nthe single lock to avoid races.\n\nIn `@apps/runtime/internal/health/service.go`:\n- Around line 256-303: PerformHealthCheck currently releases s.mu before reading\ns.components[req.AgentID], causing a data race; to fix, acquire the read lock\n(s.mu.RLock()) around the access to s.components[req.AgentID], copy the slice\n(and if components are pointers, copy the pointed values into a new slice of\nHealthComponent) into a local variable while still holding the lock, then\nrelease the lock and continue processing using that local copy; ensure\nsubsequent calls like s.checkAndGenerateAlerts use the local copy (not\ns.components) so no shared state is accessed without locking.\n\nIn `@apps/runtime/internal/universal/detector.go`:\n- Line 259: The code assigns Protocol: pkg.Protocols[0] without checking that\npkg.Protocols is non-empty, which can panic; update the code that builds the\nAgentPackage handling (the block setting Protocol) to first check\nlen(pkg.Protocols) > 0 and use pkg.Protocols[0] only when present, otherwise set\na safe default or omit the Protocol value (e.g., empty string or a sentinel like\n\"unknown\"); ensure the change references the same AgentPackage/Protocol\nassignment so the bounds check prevents index-out-of-range panics.\n\nIn `@apps/runtime/internal/universal/network.go`:\n- Around line 300-310: Disconnect currently closes a.stopCh unconditionally\nwhich panics on repeated calls; protect the close with the adapter mutex and a\nnil-check (e.g. in NetworkAdapter.Disconnect: lock a.mu, set a.running=false, if\na.stopCh != nil { close(a.stopCh); a.stopCh = nil }, unlock) so closing is\nidempotent, and ensure NetworkAdapter.Connect still creates a.stopCh and sets\nrunning=true while holding a.mu. This removes the unsafe unconditional\nclose/recreation pattern and prevents panics on repeated Disconnect calls.\n\nIn `@apps/runtime/internal/universal/social/registry.go`:\n- Around line 152-172: To avoid the RWMutex reentrancy deadlock, don't call\nRegistry.List() while holding r.mu.RLock(); instead call r.List() before\nacquiring the lock and then RLock only for copying r.manifests. Update ToJSON\n(and its use of r.manifests and r.mu) so it first sets adapters := r.List(),\nthen acquires r.mu.RLock() to iterate and copy entries from r.manifests into the\nmanifests map, then releases the lock and marshals the state.\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>🟠 Major comments (38)</summary><blockquote>\n\n<details>\n<summary>apps/runtime/internal/handoff/service.go-279-334 (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`279-334`: _⚠️ Potential issue_ | _🟠 Major_\n\n**Potential nil pointer dereference and variable shadowing issue.**\n\n1.
